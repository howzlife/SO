# Getting Started #
1

```
#!ruby

$ figaro install
```


Set this in the new config/application.yml file which will be generated when you run the above command


```
#!ruby

development:
  EMAIL_USERNAME: "myorderboard2014"
  EMAIL_PASSWORD: "goodpassword"
```


You'll need to put spaces in front of the EMAIL... variables (tabs throw an error). It will also add config/application.yml to your .gitignore file so it can't be added to your commits. If you want to know more about figaro [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro)
